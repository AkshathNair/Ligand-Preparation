# Ligand-Preparation
Ligand preparation is a critical step in molecular docking. It involves cleaning the ligand structure, adding polar hydrogens, assigning charges (e.g., Gasteiger charges), and converting the file format from PDB to PDBQT. This ensures the ligand is properly formatted and optimized for interaction studies in docking simulations like AutoDock.
