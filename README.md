# Protein-Preparation
Preparing a protein for AutoDock involves cleaning the structure by removing water molecules, adding polar hydrogens, and assigning charges (e.g., Kollman charges). The protein file is then converted from PDB to PDBQT format using AutoDockTools (ADT). This step ensures the protein is ready for molecular docking simulations.
